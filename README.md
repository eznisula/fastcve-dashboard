<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

This project is created for University of Jyväskylä's course "KYBS2004EN24K3 - Authentication, passwords and applied cryptography". The idea was to create a dashboard for FastCVE, which is a dockerized backend exposing APIs for querying CVE data (see: https://github.com/binareio/FastCVE). The dashboard was to be built on Grafana, Kibana, or something similar, and it should be running in it's own container. There should naturally be a way to configure the URL where FastCVE exposes its APIs. Having the dashboard and FastCVE containers running on the same host was OK, but showing that they are able to run on different hosts (e.g. two VMs) is more preferable. Finally, there was no strict requirements about how the dashboard should look like. What there should be was at least a search box that can be used to display search results and some visualizations. There's an image below depicting FastCVE running on the left hand side and the dashboard on the right.

Having evenings of exactly three weeks between starting to get familiar with the subject and finishing it, there are issues that I'm not personally yet happy with, but this is the best I could do with this schedule. The main problem is the lack of colorful visualizations, graphs etc., because I didn't have enough time to get that familiar with the data and design some. So creating those would be the next step for this project. This would be a rather low effort task to be honest, but the time for it is later.

### Built With

* <a href="https://github.com/binareio/FastCVE">FastCVE</a>
* <a href="https://grafana.com/">Grafana</a>
* <a href="https://www.docker.com/">Docker<a/>

<!-- GETTING STARTED -->
## Getting Started

Running the project locally requires initially just Docker and Docker Compose installed, as both FastCVE and Grafana are brought in as containers and we just configure Grafana so that we get the dashboard running. This setup was tested on two Lubuntu 24.04 LTS virtual machines running on Oracle VirtualBox, hosted on Ubuntu 24.04.1 LTS.

### Prerequisites

1. <a href="https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads">Oracle VirtualBox</a> installed on host machine to run the VMs
2. Two <a href="https://lubuntu.me/downloads/">Lubuntu OS</a> virtual machine instances created (some other OS might work as well)
3. <a href="https://www.docker.com/">Docker and Docker Compose</a> installed on both of the VMs (for Linux hosts there are also some postinstall steps to do)
4. The two VMs should be configured so that they can ping each other. What I did was to set up networking so that for both VMs there are two network adapters like so:

- Host-Only Adapter attached to "vboxnet0" (to talk to each other)
    - "vboxnet0" is a VirtualBox "Host-Only Network" 192.168.56.1/24 with DHCP address 192.168.56.100
- NAT (to access internet)


### Installation

On the VM used to run FastCVE, one can pretty much follow the installation instructions listed on their GitHub repo <a href="https://github.com/binareio/FastCVE">here</a>, but the gist of it is here:

1. Clone the FastCVE repository
2. Set some environment variables like so:
    
```sh
    export INP_ENV_NAME=dev
    export POSTGRES_PASSWORD=<insert password here>
    export FCDB_USER=<insert username here>
    export FCDB_PASS=<insert password here>
```
3. Add the same values to docker-compose.yaml
4. Request an API key from NIST <a href="https://nvd.nist.gov/developers/request-an-api-key">here</a> and set that to docker-compose.yaml as well
5. Populate the CVE, CPE, CWE, and CAPEC data for the first time (took about 25 minutes for me) running:

```sh
    docker exec fastcve load --data cve cpe cwe capec
```
6. Run the container by executing the following in FastCVE -directory:

```sh
    docker compose up
```

Next, one needs to move to the second VM used to host the Grafana dashboard. Once there:

1. Clone this repository
2. cd into it
3. Execute

```sh
    docker compose up
```

4. Browse to <a href="http://localhost:3000/dashboards">http://localhost:3000/dashboards</a> and choose the "FastCVE Dashboard" shown below

<!-- USAGE EXAMPLES -->
## Usage

Using the FastCVE dashboard is simple, as there isn't too much funcionality introduced yet. Image below shows the dashboard.

[![Dashboard Usage Screen Shot][dashboard-usage]]()

Here, quite on the top, there are five text boxes: FastCVEAddress, cveId, cweId, cpeKeyword, and capecId. There are default values in place that show what kind of input the boxes expect. We'll go these through here as well.

* "FastCVEAddress" expects a valid URL containing the protocol, address, and port (e.g. http://192.168.56.1:8000). One should input here the URL of FastCVE API interface. By default FastCVE Docker container exposes port 8000, so in addition to that one needs the IP address for example.
* "cveId" is used for searching a single CVE and displaying its information in "CVE Information" box in the dashboard. For example one could input "CVE-2024-23296" and get the related data.
* "cweId" has the same functionality as cveId above, except that it displays CWE data in "CWE Information" box and expects a valid CWE ID as input, e.g. "CWE-787".
* "cpeKeyword" box is used to look for CPE data that contains a given keyword. The data is then displayed and in case of multiple hits, paginated, in "CPE Information" box.
* "capecId" functions again in the same manner as cveId and cweId -boxes. Setting a valid CAPEC ID (e.g. CAPEC-1) in the box, one gets the related data in "CAPEC Information" box.

As there are many cells that contain more data than can be displayed in a small cell, one can hover on a given cell and click the "eye" -icon that appears on the right end of the cell, making the cell data open up in a larger side panel. What is more, one can refresh the dashboard and text boxes by clicking the "Refresh" button with two circling arrows near the top-right corner of the dashboard. The freshly inputted text box data is sent to the backend after clicking somewhere in the dashboard or pressing "Enter" key on keyboard.

<!-- ROADMAP -->
## Roadmap

- [x] Decide between Grafana, Kibana, others
- [x] Setup environment
- [x] Create one dashboard
- [x] Write documentation
- [x] Shoot an instruction video
- [ ] Add more visualization
    - Donuts, charts, etc.

See the [open issues](https://github.com/eznisula/fastcve-dashboard/issues) for a full list of proposed features (and known issues).
